## Single Responsibilty Principle:
- the class should slove only one problem it shlould have a single reason to change
- do one thing and do it well
- *Uncle Bob* : there should never br more than on reason for a class to change 
- that mean a class shloud have only one job, It’s fine to call other functionality, but it shouldn’t be written there.
