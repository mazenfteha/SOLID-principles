## Open/Closed Principle (OCP) 
- statesb that software entities classes, modules, functions, etc should be open for extention, but closed for modification

### How to implement OCP:
- allow client to access the original class with abstract and interface

- should be able to add new functionality to a class without altering its existing code. This principle encourages the use of abstraction and polymorphism.
